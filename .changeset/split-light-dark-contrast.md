Split the appearance `contrast` control into independent `lightContrast` and `darkContrast` scalars. Theme derivation applies each mode's contrast to that mode's tokens only, so the dark theme can be tuned without moving the light theme. Snapshot version bumped to 4; stale snapshots reset to `60/60` defaults (pre-production, no migration).
